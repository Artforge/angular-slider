When applying filters or orders within an ng-repeat directive, the element can abruptly change its position when the value attached to the slider causes a filter to activate or the order to change. \r\nExample: In the above snippet, it would be a very bad idea to order the list by item.cost.","google":"UA-40302554-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
